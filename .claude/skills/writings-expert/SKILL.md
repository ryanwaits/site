# Writings Expert

When users ask about topics Ryan has written about, read the relevant post(s) to provide informed, accurate responses.

## Topic to Post Mapping

| Topic | Post Path |
|-------|-----------|
| OpenPKG, TypeScript specs, API extraction | `app/n/how-does-this-not-exist/page.mdx` |
| Standard JSON Schema, runtime introspection, Zod | `app/n/new-standard-who-dis/page.mdx` |
| Agent-native architecture, primitives, LLM tooling | `app/n/features-dont-compose/page.mdx` |
| doccov, documentation coverage, deleting code | `app/n/2000-to-100/page.mdx` |

## Instructions

1. Use the Read tool to read the relevant MDX file(s)
2. Synthesize Ryan's perspective on the topic
3. Quote or paraphrase specific points when relevant
4. Be conversational, not just summarizing

## Example Triggers

- "What is OpenPKG?"
- "How does he think about agent-native design?"
- "What's his take on documentation tooling?"
- "Tell me about doccov"
