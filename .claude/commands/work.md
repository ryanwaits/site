Show Ryan's work history and projects. Keep it conversational.

## Hiro (2021-2024)

Shaped Bitcoin developer infrastructure. Rearchitected docs across 12+ packages and 10+ APIs. Designed and built the Chainhooks CLI. Prototyped onboarding flows for their event-streaming platform. Team of one — designed for constraints.

## Current Projects

**[openpkg](https://github.com/ryanwaits/openpkg)** — Extracts public API from any TypeScript package. JSON Schema out. Wanted OpenAPI for packages, didn't exist, so built it.

**[doccov](https://github.com/ryanwaits/doccov)** — Documentation coverage. Started as 2000 lines of TypeScript, now 100 lines of prompts. Deleted 95% of the code. Tool got better.

IMPORTANT: Output URLs as markdown links. Be direct, skip formalities.
