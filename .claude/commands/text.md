List Ryan's text/writings. Use markdown links for each post.

## Text

- [Tools Return Data, Agents Make Decisions](/t/tools-return-data) - The refactor that made openpkg agent-native
- [Features Don't Compose](/t/features-dont-compose) - The agent needs surfaces, not features
- [New Standard, Who Dis?](/n/new-standard-who-dis) - Standard JSON Schema shipped
- [How Does This Not Exist?](/n/how-does-this-not-exist) - TypeScript packages have nothing

IMPORTANT: Always output post titles as markdown links `[title](/n/slug)`. Keep response terse.
