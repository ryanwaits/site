# From 2000 Lines to 100

This is the project I teased in ["Features Don't Compose"](/t/features-dont-compose).

doccov started as a CLI. 2000 lines of TypeScript. Months of work building what I thought would be the first real product on top of [OpenPKG](/t/how-does-this-not-exist) — a tool that could measure documentation coverage, catch drift, flag what's missing.

It worked. But something felt off. Overengineered in a way I couldn't articulate.

Then I read the ["Agent-Native Architecture"](https://blog.val.town/blog/agent-native/) guide, and it clicked immediately. All those if-statements deciding what counted as "documented"? What level of drift was acceptable? When a warning should become an error?

That's not logic. That's judgment. And judgment is what LLMs do.

## The deletion

The entire doccov CLI reduced to a question: given an API surface and its documentation, what's missing or wrong?

That question doesn't need 2000 lines. It needs a prompt.

So I deleted the CLI. Wrote a skill file instead — about 100 lines of prose explaining what openpkg primitives exist, how to compose them, what to look for, how to report findings.

No code. No releases. No maintenance.

It felt a little sad — months of work, gone. But it also felt right. The overengineering finally had an explanation: I'd been encoding judgment in code when it belonged in prose.

## What it enables

The skill doesn't just do what the CLI did. It does things I never built features for. No feature request. No code change. Just a different prompt.

That's the point. The CLI could only do what I explicitly built. The skill can do whatever the primitives allow — which turns out to be a lot more.

## The principle

2000 lines of judgment encoded in code. 100 lines of judgment encoded in prose. Same capability, 95% less maintenance.

New features = new prompts, not new code.
