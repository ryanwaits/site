# Codecov, But for Docs

Code coverage has tooling. Test coverage has tooling. Documentation coverage? Nothing.

The question is simple: for a given TypeScript package, which exports are documented and which aren't?

Seems like this should exist. Codecov badges are everywhere. Where's the equivalent for docs?

Building it. More soon.
